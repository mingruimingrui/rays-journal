If anyone tells you that machine learning is easy, don't believe them. People who say that probably belong to the world's top 10% mathematical talent. No one would EVER be in their right mind to spend their free time learning something as difficult as machine learning so thank you for not being in your right mind and coming to this site to read this article. I take the fact that you are reading this that you are willing to spend the next 1-2 hours of your life reading and re-reading paragraphs to understand what's going on. So here we go, ML - the hard way.
