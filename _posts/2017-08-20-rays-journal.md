Looking back to the last nine months of my life, I couldn't help but feel amazed by the amount of changes that's happened.

Just 9 months prior, you would probably consider me your typical college loser. I was the kind who isn't particularly good at anything and plays video games all day. It wasn't that I don't wish to breakout of that cycle but it was more like I didn't know how to. There was no close person for me to talk to, I did not have any interests or hobbies and (you know) society also sort of don't want to associate itself with the sort of person I was. I had people who I can call friends but I felt absolutely alone. It was only recently that I realized that what I truly needed was a close intimate relationship which I did not have during those days.
