When I was in primary school, I was told that if I had worked hard enough, I could do anything I want. The concept of working for something you desire was repeated to me for as long as I could remember but for the longest time I just struggled to carry it out. I think the moment that my life really took a turn was, of all things, when I decided to pick up machine learning.

It was the December of 2016 that I heard about this course online that teaches ML for free. It wasn't as if that I had planned to be learning something meaning, it was more like I couldn't figure out how to spend my winter holiday. I think that at this point it wouldn't surprise anyone if I had said that I used to close myself off to the world and that was exactly the way I was back then. It wasn't a history I was particularly proud of but looking back, the things that I was able to achieve in just 10 months wouldn't seem that impressive.

In a month after completing the course taught by Andrew Ng, I began working on Kaggle problems and that was where I met soo many amazing people who are soo willing share and teach each other about the field of data science. Two months after that, I got my first Kaggle placing. It wasn't a particularly good placing but at that point of time, it had meant the world to me. March of 2017 was when I got my first bit of offline recognition in a small college-based competition. June was when I first began learning about deep learning. Thinking back to how my experience learning about data science on Kaggle was like, I wrote my first article on deep learning. Primarily I wanted it to be a didactic read, because I personally found deep learning deceptively simple. Before I knew it, I was teaching machine learning know-how to classes and even got the chance to deliver a lecture for a post-doc seminar.

My greatest take-away from learning about machine learning was probably this. That you don't have to be afraid of hard work. There was this fear that I used to have of not being able to achieve the things I've set out to do but now I know that it doesn't really matter if I do not end up reaching my goal. Because the process of working and all the self-improvements it brings along already takes you away from where you started off from and anywhere is better than staying in stagnation.

Even now to think that it all began after taking that first insignificant step, it was still amazing. I try not to let myself get too happy because there I can still get soo much better and honestly it is just soo much fun having discovered something you can be passionate about in life.
